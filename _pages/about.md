I am a fresh graduate from University of Toulouse - Capitole. Before that I have worked as data analyst in humanitarian projects with United Nations.


Research interests
======
I am interested and actively working in computer vision domain. During my Master's internship at L2TI laboratory of USPN (University of Sorbonne Paris Nord) I worked on fusion of multi-modal (RGB & IR) data in aerial images for the purpose of object detection and I leveraged the simple cross attention mechanism for doing so. I am also excited about foundation models, and vision-language models.

Selected projects
======
1. Multimodal Transformer Using Cross-Channel attention for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images:
Object detection in Remote Sensing Images (RSI) is a critical task for numerous applications in Earth Observation (EO). We propose a multimodal transformer exploring multi-source remote sensing data for object detection. Instead of directly combining the multimodal input through a channel-wise concatenation, which ignores the heterogeneity of different modalities, we use a cross-channel attention module which learns the relationship between different channels, enabling the construction of a coherent multimodal input by aligning the different modalities at the early stage.

2. Fine-tune LLAMA-v2 on personal chat data
Llama v2 7b is a large language model (LLM) with 7 billion parameters that can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, translation, and question answering. However it can be fine-tuned on any other specific use such as on personal chat data for personal purposes using freely available colab GPU.
