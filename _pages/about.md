I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master’s degree (M2) in **Mathematics, Vision & Learning (MVA)** from **École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay**, and a Master’s degree in **MIAGE** from the University of Toulouse-Capitole.  
My work spans **deep learning, multimodal modeling, reinforcement learning, and LLM/VLM research**, with hands-on experience both in academic labs and applied ML roles.

I have previously worked as:

- **Research Engineer**, L2TI Lab, Université Sorbonne Paris-Nord, wroked on multimodal object detection, few-shot learning, transformer-based models, and dataset creation.  
- **ML Engineer & Data Analyst**, United Nations programs: applied ML, analytics, image analysis.  
- **Research Intern**, ISIR Lab (Sorbonne University): reinforcement learning with LLMs/VLMs, exploration dynamics, and value modeling.

My research includes a **peer-reviewed journal publication**, an **ICIP 2024 oral presentation**, and an **arXiv preprint**.
